# SleepingPredictor


Sleeping predictor based on NeuralProphet library (https://github.com/ourownstory/neural\_prophet)

Input datas are CSV extracted from connected watch (Fitbit), but code could be adapted for other wearable electronic devices.
Arranging parsing could be necessary if other data sources are used.
